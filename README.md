fakedatafs is a file system that generates fake data on demand in a
deterministic way. It is implemented as a FUSE module and can be used to test
backup software.

Build fakedatafs
================

Install Go/Golang (at least version 1.11), then run `go build`,
afterwards you'll find the binary in the current directory:

    $ go build

    $ ./fakedatafs /mnt/dir
    filesystem mounted at /mnt/dir

    $ ls -al /mnt/dir
    total 5078
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  15327 Aug 30  1754 file-121872730593067849
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  89978 Aug 30  1754 file-1269644873002022781

At the moment, the only tested compiler for restic is the official Go compiler.
Building restic with gccgo may work, but is not supported.
